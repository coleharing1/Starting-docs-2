# Context Management

## Session Start Protocol
1.  Read `@project-history.md` first to understand previous work.
2.  Check the last update timestamp to gauge session freshness.
3.  Reference recent changes when making architectural decisions.
4.  Consult `@CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and status.

## File Modification Tracking
- At 5 file modifications: "üìù Consider updating project-history.md with recent changes."
- At 10 file modifications: "‚ö†Ô∏è It's a good time to update project-history.md now to ensure context is not lost."
- Reset counter after a history update.

## Context Recovery Protocol
- If context seems lost or actions are repetitive, immediately re-read `@project-history.md`.
- Cross-reference with `@CLAUDE.md` and the project's core documentation to re-establish a baseline understanding.
