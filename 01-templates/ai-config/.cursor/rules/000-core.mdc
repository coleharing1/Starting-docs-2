# Core Universal Rules

## Code Quality
- Files MUST be under 500 lines.
- Only modify code relevant to the request.
- No placeholders like "// ... rest of code".
- Complete all implementations.

## Programming Patterns
- Prefer functional and declarative programming.
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Throw errors explicitly; avoid silent failures.
- Add `@fileoverview` to all new files.

## AI Interaction
- Ask clarifying questions only when truly ambiguous.
- Reference existing patterns and files first.
- Update `project-history.md` every 5-10 file changes.
