# Python Development Rules

## Framework
- Prefer FastAPI for APIs; use Pydantic models for validation.
- Structure modules by feature; avoid giant files.

## Tooling
- Use `ruff` and `black` for lint/format.
- Add type hints; enable `mypy` for critical modules.

## Testing
- Use `pytest`; keep tests small and isolated.
- Mock external services; avoid network calls.
