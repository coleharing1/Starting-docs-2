# Documentation Rules

## Style
- Prefer short sections and bullets over long paragraphs.
- Keep files under 500 lines; split when longer.
- Use valid Markdown tables; include headers and separators.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags; avoid placeholders.

## Structure
- Add a clear title and short purpose statement at top.
- Link to related docs (e.g., Start Here, Prompts) when relevant.
- Keep prompts under `03-guides/workflow/prompts/`.
- Place audits under `03-guides/maintenance/audits/`.

## Maintenance
- Update cross-references after file moves.
- When deprecating, add a banner and move to `_archive/`.
