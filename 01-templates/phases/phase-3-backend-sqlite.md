# Phase 3: Backend Integration with SQLite

## Overview
Connect the frontend features from Phase 2 to a local SQLite database. This phase focuses on implementing API routes, data fetching, and local authentication without touching production infrastructure.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All frontend features are connected to backend APIs.
- [ ] CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fully functional.
- [ ] Local authentication (e.g., NextAuth with credentials provider) is working.
- [ ] Data is persisted in the local SQLite database.
- [ ] API routes are tested and documented.
