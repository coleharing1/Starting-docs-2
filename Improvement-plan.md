## Cursor Starter Kit Improvement Plan

Below is a prioritized, action-oriented checklist to harden and streamline your `Starting-Documents/` kit. Each item includes rank, impact, and effort.

### Legend
- Rank: P0 Critical, P1 High, P2 Medium, P3 Low
- Effort: S (≤30m), M (≤2h), L (≤1 day), XL (>1 day)

### P0 — Critical (fix before next use)

- Standardize framework versions or make docs version-agnostic
  - Impact: Prevents confusion during setup; reduces rework.
  - Why: Docs cite “Next.js 15 / React 19” while `package.json` uses Next 14.x / React 18.x.
  - Affects: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`, `README.md`, `01-templates/project-docs/TECH-STACK-TEMP.md`.
  - Fix: Choose “current LTS” phrasing or bump the example `package.json` and any version-coupled snippets.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0
  - Status: ✅

- Modernize Cursor rules to 2025 modular architecture
  - Impact: Prevents context bloat; aligns with Cursor loading behavior; fewer AI mistakes.
  - Why: `fileGlobs` is deprecated; index must not be alwaysApply; total always-apply <200 lines; add `priority` and `context_limit`.
  - Affects: `01-templates/ai-config/rules.mdc`, references in `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`, `03-guides/setup/CURSOR-RULES-SETUP-GUIDE-2025.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Make `.cursor/rules.mdc` an index with `alwaysApply: false` (NOT .cursorrules - that's legacy).
    - Add `.cursor/rules/000-core.mdc` and `900-context.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true`, `priority`, `context_limit`.
    - Add domain modules (frontend/backend/testing/docs) using `globs`.
    - Ensure we use modern `.cursor/rules.mdc` format, not legacy `.cursorrules`.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0

- Fix broken references and add missing phase templates
  - Impact: Eliminates dead-ends; keeps the phased workflow usable.
  - Why: GROK references `PAGES-URLS_INS.md` (doesn’t exist), and phase docs 3–5 are referenced but missing.
  - Affects: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`, `01-templates/phases/`.
  - Fix:
    - Replace `PAGES-URLS_INS.md` with `01-templates/checklists/PAGES-URLS-TEMPLATE.md`.
    - Add `phase-3-backend-sqlite.md`, `phase-4-testing-polish.md`, `phase-5-production-supabase.md`.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0
  - Status: ✅

- Harden `setup.sh` for reliability and non-interactive usage
  - Impact: Removes “first run” breakages; supports automation.
  - Why: Uses `npx json` without installing; `@prisma/client` should be runtime dep; Playwright duplication; path assumptions.
  - Affects: `setup.sh`.
  - Fix:
    - Add `npm i -D json` (or replace with `jq`/simple Node script), or avoid mutation by writing scripts once.
    - Move `@prisma/client` to `dependencies`.
    - Ensure only `@playwright/test` is used.
    - Verify Tailwind/shadcn paths match `create-next-app` output; adjust if needed.
    - Add optional non-interactive mode: respect `PROJECT_NAME` env var and default when empty.
    - Add post-setup reminder: `npx playwright install` (to install required browsers for Playwright).
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0

- Split overlong start-here guide into sub-guides (<500 lines each)
  - Impact: Better AI compatibility; faster comprehension.
  - Why: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md` ~700 lines violates your own <500 rule.
  - Affects: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`.
  - Fix: Break into:
    - `START-HERE.md` (10‑minute kickoff)
    - `CURSOR-RULES-INDEX.md` (how to enable modules)
    - `PHASES-INDEX.md` (links to phase templates)
    - `APPENDIX-LEGACY.md` (legacy prompts/variants)
  - Effort: L
  - Rank: P0
  - Status: ✅

- Normalize workflow file names and remove/label speculative content
  - Impact: Avoids confusion; reduces noise in Knowledge uploads.
  - Why: Typo and mixed casing; hypothetical Gemini CLI doc.
  - Affects: `03-guides/workflow/Ai-Worklfow-Combined.md`, `03-guides/workflow/Ai-workflow-Gemini-CLI.md`, other "AI/Ai" files.
  - Fix:
    - Rename to `AI-Workflow-Combined.md` (consistent casing).
    - Delete or add a first-line banner in `Ai-workflow-Gemini-CLI.md`: "This is a theoretical exploration—do not treat as current functionality."
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P0
  - Status: ✅

- Clarify template vs generated files in documentation
  - Impact: Prevents confusion about missing files; sets correct expectations.
  - Why: Users expect files like `.env.local.example`, `_docs/`, `project_brainstorm/` in this repo, but they're generated by setup.sh.
  - Affects: `README.md`, `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Add clear section distinguishing "Templates (in this repo)" vs "Generated (in your project)".
    - Update repo structure map to show what's here vs what gets created.
    - Optional: Add placeholder folders/files with README explaining they're examples.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P0
  - Status: ✅

### P1 — High (polish in the next pass)

- Consolidate MCP naming to a single package
  - Impact: Avoids install/config mistakes.
  - Why: Mixed naming: `supabase-mcp`, `@supabase/mcp-server`, `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase`.
  - Affects: `MCP-SETUP-GUIDE.md`, `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`.
  - Fix: Use `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` consistently.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P1
  - Status: ✅

- Expand `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` with troubleshooting and rollback
  - Impact: Beginner success in production.
  - Why: Depth imbalance vs other docs.
  - Affects: `03-guides/setup/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Add “Common Errors” (Node version mismatch, pooler config, env var scoping).
    - Add rollback patterns (preview/prod, canary, revert).
    - Add a pre-deploy checklist (RLS, migrations applied, smoke tests).
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P1
  - Status: ✅

- Move or rename the example `package.json`
  - Impact: Reduces confusion; aligns expectations.
  - Why: `Starting-Documents/package.json` suggests a runnable app but this folder is a docs kit.
  - Affects: `package.json`, `README.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Prefer renaming to `package.template.json` with a top-of-file note "example only; not a runnable manifest in this repo" to avoid path churn.
    - Alternatively, move it under `01-templates/project-skeleton/` with a README: "Use this as an example app manifest."
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P1
  - Status: ✅

- Fix formatting issues in DATABASE-OVERVIEW.md
  - Impact: Significantly improves readability and usability.
  - Why: Excessive markdown escaping, missing step 2 in numbering, poor structure.
  - Affects: `03-guides/setup/DATABASE-OVERVIEW.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Remove unnecessary backslash escaping.
    - Fix numbering sequence (add missing step 2).
    - Clean up formatting for better readability.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P1
  - Status: ✅

- Document Snyk token setup for CI/CD (optional)
  - Impact: Enables security scanning in CI/CD pipeline.
  - Why: GitHub Actions workflow references Snyk but lacks setup instructions.
  - Affects: generated project's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (created by `setup.sh`), deployment documentation.
  - Fix:
    - Add "Optional Security Scanning" section with Snyk setup.
    - Make it clear this is optional, not required.
    - Provide environment variable configuration steps.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P1
  - Status: ✅

### P2 — Medium (quality, consistency, and automation)

- Fix formatting in checklist templates
  - Impact: Better rendering and copy/paste.
  - Why: Invalid table structures, missing proper markdown formatting.
  - Affects: `01-templates/checklists/PAGES-URLS-TEMPLATE.md`, `01-templates/checklists/KEY-FEATURES-TEMPLATE.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Convert example tables to valid pipe tables; include headers and separators.
    - Add proper markdown structure with headers and sections.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Add markdown linting to docs workflow
  - Impact: Prevents regressions; enforces consistency.
  - Why: Many markdowns; lots of contributors (human and AI).
  - Affects: CONTRIBUTING notes in `README.md`; optional dev tooling note in GROK/Setup docs.
  - Fix:
    - Recommend `markdownlint-cli` with a sample config and pre-commit usage.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Document optional vs essential dependencies
  - Impact: Smaller initial installs; clearer choices.
  - Why: Many Radix components listed; not all needed for MVP.
  - Affects: `README.md`, `TECH-STACK-TEMP.md`, `setup.sh` commentary.
  - Fix:
    - Identify “core UI deps” vs “optional component add-ons”; suggest adding on demand (e.g., via shadcn CLI).
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Provide a minimal “Start Here” nav index
  - Impact: Faster onboarding.
  - Why: Users need a shortest path.
  - Affects: new `START-HERE.md`, `README.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Add a 1-page navigation with: 1) Upload list; 2) Three prompts to generate `project-overview.md`, `user-flow.md`, `tech-stack.md`; 3) Phase docs links.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Normalize naming across templates
  - Impact: Easier to script and grep; fewer reference errors.
  - Why: Mixed `-TEMP` vs `-TEMPLATE`.
  - Affects: All `01-templates/project-docs/*`.
  - Fix:
    - Standardize on `-TEMPLATE.md` endings; update all references.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Add `fix-structure.sh` helper script
  - Impact: One-click rename/cleanup when adopting the kit; high value for new users.
  - Why: New users forget to rename files and clean speculative docs.
  - Affects: new `fix-structure.sh`.
  - Fix:
    - Script common renames, optional deletions (e.g., Gemini CLI doc), and markdown lint run.
    - Include validation checks for required files.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Create validation script/runbook
  - Impact: Ensures all fixes are properly applied; prevents regressions.
  - Why: Need to verify the kit works end-to-end after changes.
  - Affects: new `validate-kit.sh` or `VALIDATION.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Create script or markdown runbook that checks all critical paths.
    - Include checks for file existence, naming conventions, line counts.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P2

  - Why: Breaking changes in rules format, file structure.
  - Affects: new `MIGRATION.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Document changes from old to new format.
    - Provide step-by-step migration instructions.
    - Include rollback procedures if needed.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P2

- Create CHANGELOG.md
  - Impact: Track changes over time; communicate updates to users.
  - Why: Users need to know what changed between versions.
  - Affects: new `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Start with current version and planned changes.
    - Use standard format (Keep a Changelog).
    - Include breaking changes, additions, fixes.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

### Generalization for multi‑stack Cursor projects

The starter should be neutral and usable across multiple tech stacks. These items decouple stack specifics and introduce profiles.

#### P0 — De‑specificize core docs and rules

- Neutralize stack‑specific language in core docs
  - Impact: Core docs fit any project type; fewer false assumptions.
  - Why: Many sections assume Next.js/React/Tailwind/Prisma.
  - Affects: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`, `TECH-STACK-TEMP.md`, `PROJECT-RULES-TEMP.md`, `README.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Replace hard references (e.g., “Next.js App Router”, “Vercel”, “NextAuth”, “Prisma/SQLite”) with neutral phrasing: “your framework’s router”, “your deploy platform”, “your auth provider”, “your ORM/DB”.
    - Add a “Choose‑your‑stack” decision matrix (Frontend, Backend, Styling, State, Forms, Testing, DB, Auth, Deploy) with options and trade‑offs.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0

- Expand modular rules beyond React/Node
  - Impact: Rules load only what’s relevant per project; less context bloat.
  - Why: Existing examples bias toward React UI.
  - Affects: `.cursor/rules.mdc` index, `.cursor/rules/` modules.
  - Fix:
    - Keep neutral always‑apply: `000-core.mdc`, `900-context.mdc`.
    - Add optional modules: `modules/frontend-react.mdc`, `modules/backend-node.mdc`, `modules/python.mdc`, `modules/testing.mdc`, `modules/docs.mdc` using `globs`, `priority`, `context_limit`.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P0

#### P1 — Introduce profiles and variant phases

- Add profiles directory and move framework‑specific content
  - Impact: Clear separation between generic core and stack profiles.
  - Why: Next.js specifics should be opt‑in.
  - Affects: new `profiles/`.
  - Fix:
    - Create `profiles/nextjs-react/` and move: Next‑specific setup notes, shadcn/Radix guidance, NextAuth, Vercel deploy steps, and a profile README.
    - Link profile‑specific rules modules from the profile README.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P1

- Provide phase variants by project type
  - Impact: Phases fit different kinds of projects.
  - Why: Current phases are frontend‑first web app–centric.
  - Affects: new `01-templates/phases/INDEX.md` and variant checklists.
  - Fix:
    - Add mappings for: App (web UI), API/Service, CLI/Tooling, Library/Package, Docs Site; each links to tailored checklists.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P1

- MCP documentation generalization
  - Impact: Works whether using Supabase or other providers.
  - Why: Current guide is Supabase‑specific.
  - Affects: `03-guides/setup/`.
  - Fix:
    - Rename current to `MCP-SETUP-SUPABASE.md` and add `MCP-SETUP-GENERIC.md` with placeholders and links for other servers (Postgres/HTTP/SQLite).
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P1

#### P2 — Scripts, prompts, and optional tool guidance

- Generalize setup scripts
  - Impact: Usable for docs‑only or non‑Next projects.
  - Why: Current `setup.sh` is opinionated.
  - Affects: `setup.sh` and new scripts.
  - Fix:
    - Rename current to `setup-next-web.sh` (keep behavior).
    - Add `bootstrap-docs.sh` to create only `_docs`, `project_brainstorm`, `.cursor/` with neutral defaults.
    - Plan future: `setup-node-api.sh`, `setup-fastapi.sh` (stubs acceptable).
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P2

- Add choice prompts and mark optional sections
  - Impact: Better UX during GROK flow.
  - Why: Users need to select a profile or stay generic.
  - Affects: `GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md`, `THEME/UI` templates.
  - Fix:
    - Add Step 0 in GROK: “Select a profile or continue in generic mode.”
    - Prefix shadcn/Radix/Zustand/RHF sections with “Optional (React profile)”.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

- Broaden options sections in core templates
  - Impact: Encourages informed choices.
  - Why: Single‑path bias today.
  - Affects: `TECH-STACK-TEMP.md`, `PROJECT-RULES-TEMP.md`, `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`.
  - Fix:
    - Add options with brief pros/cons for DBs (SQLite/Postgres/Mongo/None), Auth (Auth.js/Auth0/Clerk/Supabase/custom), Deploy (Vercel/Netlify/Fly/Render/AWS), Testing (Jest/Vitest; Cypress/Playwright).
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P2

### P3 — Low (nice-to-have, incremental)

- Add more real-world example themes
  - Impact: Better design starting points.
  - Why: Only `TAN-THEME-RULES.md`.
  - Affects: `02-examples/themes/`.
  - Fix:
    - Add 1–2 more: “Minimalist Neutral”, “Dark Pro”.
  - Effort: M
  - Rank: P3

- Clarify LLM voice in templates
  - Impact: Cleaner outputs; fewer persona conflicts.
  - Why: Mixed “you” vs “the LLM”.
  - Affects: `01-templates/project-docs/*`, `Saved_Prompts/*`.
  - Fix:
    - Add a short “authoring voice” note at the top of instruction-style templates.
  - Effort: S
  - Rank: P3

### Cross-Cutting Acceptance Criteria

- After changes:
  - All template references resolve to existing files; no dead links.
  - All multi-part guides are ≤500 lines; headings are consistent; code fences valid.
  - Cursor rules use modular files with `globs`, `priority`, `context_limit`; index not alwaysApply; total always-apply <200 lines.
  - `setup.sh` runs cleanly on a fresh machine without manual fixes; supports non-interactive input.
  - README and “Start Here” clearly distinguish templates vs generated files and provide a 10-minute onboarding path.

### Quick Hits (high ROI, ≤30 minutes each)

- Fix filename: `Ai-Worklfow-Combined.md` → `AI-Workflow-Combined.md` (P0).
- Add banner to `Ai-workflow-Gemini-CLI.md` or delete it (P0).
- Replace all `fileGlobs` → `
