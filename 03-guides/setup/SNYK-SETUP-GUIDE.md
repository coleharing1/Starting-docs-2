# Optional: Snyk Security Scanning Setup

This guide explains how to set up Snyk security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline, as referenced in the example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) created by `setup.sh`.

**Why use Snyk?** Snyk helps you find and fix security vulnerabilities in your open-source dependencies and application code.

## Prerequisites
- A [Snyk account](https://snyk.io/) (a free account is sufficient to start).
- Your project is hosted on GitHub.

## Step 1: Get Your Snyk Authentication Token
1.  Log in to your Snyk account.
2.  Navigate to your **Account Settings**.
3.  Find the **Auth Token** section.
4.  Copy your secret token. **Treat this like a password and do not expose it.**

## Step 2: Add the Snyk Token to GitHub Secrets
1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click on **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3.  Click **New repository secret**.
4.  Name the secret `SNYK_TOKEN`.
5.  Paste the Snyk authentication token you copied into the "Secret" field.
6.  Click **Add secret**.

## Step 3: Enable Snyk in Your GitHub Actions Workflow
The example `ci.yml` file generated by `setup.sh` may contain a commented-out section for Snyk. To enable it:

1.  Open `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your generated project.
2.  Find the section related to Snyk. It might look like this:

    ```yaml
    # - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
    #   uses: snyk/actions/node@master
    #   continue-on-error: true # To prevent breaking main builds
    #   env:
    #     SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
    #   with:
    #     command: monitor
    ```

3.  Uncomment these lines.
4.  Commit and push the change.

Now, on every push to your main branches, the CI pipeline will run Snyk to monitor your dependencies for new vulnerabilities.

## How It Works
- The `snyk/actions/node@master` action runs the Snyk CLI.
- `env: SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}` securely provides your Snyk token to the action.
- `with: command: monitor` tells Snyk to take a snapshot of your dependencies and monitor them over time, alerting you to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- `continue-on-error: true` is recommended so that new vulnerabilities don't block your entire build pipeline, but you will still be notified. You can set this to `false` for stricter security.
