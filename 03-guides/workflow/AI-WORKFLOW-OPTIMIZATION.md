# AI Workflow Optimization Guide for Cursor & Claude Code (August 2025)

This guide provides advanced workflow optimizations for developers using AI assistants in their development process. It covers strategies for maximizing productivity with Cursor AI and Claude Code, based on the latest best practices as of August 2025.

## Core Workflow Principle: The Edit-Test Loop

The foundation of effective AI-assisted development is establishing a tight edit-test loop:

1. **AI writes the code** (based on your specifications)
2. **AI writes the test** (to verify the code works)
3. **AI executes the test** (finding and fixing bugs automatically)
4. **You review and iterate** (ensuring quality and requirements are met)

This loop can increase development speed by 5-30x when properly configured.

## Cursor vs Claude Code: When to Use Each

### Use Cursor When:
- Working on existing codebases with complex context
- Need inline editing with Cmd/Ctrl+K
- Multi-file refactoring with Composer
- Want IDE integration with debugging and testing
- Collaborating with team using shared .cursorrules

### Use Claude Code When:
- Starting new projects or features from scratch
- Need persistent memory across sessions (CLAUDE.md)
- Want autonomous agent capabilities
- Building with natural conversation flow
- Require multiple parallel instances working on different parts

### Hybrid Workflow (Recommended):
1. Use Claude Code for initial planning and architecture
2. Switch to Cursor for implementation and refinement
3. Use both tools simultaneously for different aspects
4. Share context via CLAUDE.md and .cursor/rules.mdc

## Essential Configuration Settings

### Cursor Configuration

#### 1. Enable Auto-Save
```json
// settings.json
{
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000
}
```
**Why**: Enables instant hot-reload, making the frontend development cycle much smoother.

#### 2. Set Up Yolo Mode
- Go to Settings > Features > Enable "Allow Running Commands"
- Whitelist frequently used commands:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run dev`
  - `tsc`
  - `npx supabase db reset`
  
**Why**: Allows AI to run tests and fix errors without constant confirmation prompts.

#### 3. Configure Test Automation
```bash
# In terminal, let AI run:
tsc --noEmit  # Check for TypeScript errors
npm test       # Run test suite
```
**Why**: AI can automatically fix build errors across all files iteratively.

### Claude Code Configuration

#### 1. Initialize Project Memory
```bash
/init  # Creates CLAUDE.md for persistent context
```

#### 2. Set Up Multi-Instance Workflow
- Open multiple Claude Code windows
- Each shares the same CLAUDE.md
- Assign different tasks to each instance
- They coordinate through shared memory

## Context Management Strategies

### The Power of Reference
Instead of:
> "Make a dropdown menu component"

Use:
> "Make a dropdown menu component similar to the Select component in @components/Select.tsx"

This small change dramatically improves output quality by:
- Matching your existing code style
- Following established patterns
- Maintaining consistency

### Effective Documentation Structure
```
docs/ai-context/
├── architecture.mermaid   # Visual system overview
├── technical.md           # Technical decisions and rationale
├── status.md             # Current development status
├── patterns.md           # Code patterns and examples
└── tasks.md              # Prioritized task list
```

### Knowledge Upload Strategy
1. **Essential Files** (always include):
   - CLAUDE.md
   - .cursor/rules.mdc
   - project-overview.md
   - tech-stack.md

2. **Context-Specific** (include as needed):
   - Relevant component files
   - Test files for similar features
   - API documentation
   - Database schema

## Workflow Optimizations

### Morning Sharp, Afternoon Assisted
- **Morning (when sharp)**: Plan complex features with minimal AI
- **Afternoon**: Use Agent mode to implement planned features
- **Evening**: Let AI handle repetitive tasks and cleanup

### Small Commits, Clean History
```bash
# Keep working directory clean
git add -p  # Stage selectively
git commit -m "feat: specific change"

# Easy reversion if AI makes mistakes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### The Review Button Pattern
1. Let AI make changes
2. Always click "Review" to see full diff
3. Keep changes small and focused
4. Test immediately
5. Commit if successful

## Advanced Techniques

### Automated Error Resolution
```bash
# Enable in Cursor terminal
while ! npm run build; do
  echo "Build failed, AI fixing..."
  # AI automatically fixes errors
done
```

### Parallel Development
With multiple Claude Code instances:
- Instance 1: Frontend components
- Instance 2: Backend APIs
- Instance 3: Tests and documentation
- All sharing context via CLAUDE.md

### Test-Driven AI Development
```yaml
# Workflow
1. Write test specification first
2. AI generates implementation
3. AI runs test
4. AI fixes failures
5. Repeat until passing
```

## Performance Metrics

Track these metrics to measure AI effectiveness:
- **Code Generation Speed**: Lines per hour
- **Bug Rate**: Bugs per 1000 lines
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained above 80%
- **Review Time**: Minutes per PR
- **Rework Rate**: Percentage of AI code needing manual fixes

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Context Overload
**Problem**: AI gets confused with too much context
**Solution**: Use focused prompts with specific file references

### Pitfall 2: Placeholder Code
**Problem**: AI uses `// ... rest of code` placeholders
**Solution**: Add to rules: "Never use placeholders, always complete implementations"

### Pitfall 3: Style Drift
**Problem**: AI code doesn't match project style
**Solution**: Reference existing similar components in every prompt

### Pitfall 4: Over-Reliance
**Problem**: Not understanding AI-generated code
**Solution**: Always review, ask for explanations, maintain ownership

## Security Considerations

### MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--read-only"  // Always use read-only for safety
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Review Requirements
- Always review database operations
- Check for exposed secrets
- Verify input validation
- Confirm error handling

{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test && npm run lint",
      "post-commit": "npm run update-claude-md"
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
name: AI Code Review

      - name: AI Review
        run: |
          # AI reviews PR for patterns
          # Checks against .cursor/rules.mdc
```

## Debugging with AI

### Effective Error Resolution
1. Copy full error message
2. Include file path and line numbers
3. Reference relevant documentation
4. Ask for step-by-step debugging

### Pattern Recognition
> "This error is similar to what we fixed in @components/UserList.tsx. Apply the same solution here."
