Awesome brief. I read your AI‑WORKFLOW‑OPTIMIZATION doc and then dug around the web to see how devs actually run **Claude Code + Cursor together** in 2025. Short version: your recommended hybrid (Claude for planning/agentic work, Cursor for implementation/diffs) matches what the community is doing, especially when paired with CLAUDE.md and tight edit‑test loops.&#x20;

Below is a ranked list of the **most common strategies** people use to combine them—each with a **popularity score** (0–100, based on how often it appeared across official docs, blog posts, Reddit/YouTube in the last \~2 months) and an **overall score** (my take on net value = speed × quality − overhead).

# How people use Claude Code + Cursor together (ranked)

### 1) Run **Claude Code *inside* Cursor** and use Cursor’s diffs as the “glass pane”

**How it works:** Install Claude Code and launch it from Cursor’s integrated terminal; CC detects the IDE and shows changes in Cursor’s diff UI. You chat/iterate in CC, review and accept in Cursor. Popular for day‑to‑day building and debugging.
**Where I saw it:** Anthropic’s “Add Claude Code to your IDE” (explicitly lists Cursor), setup guides, and a bunch of posts/videos reporting that the integration is now smooth. ([Anthropic][1], [Buildcamp][2], [YouTube][3])
**Popularity:** **95/100**
**Pros:** One window; great diffs; fast accept/reject; minimal context loss.
**Cons:** Occasional install hiccups on Windows/WSL; you still need to be disciplined about small diffs. ([Cursor - Community Forum][4])
**Overall score:** **9.2/10**

---

### 2) **Parallelize work** with multiple Claude Code sessions via **git worktrees**, merge/review in Cursor

**How it works:** Spin up separate branches as worktrees (feature‑A, bugfix‑B, etc.), run a CC instance per worktree, then use Cursor to review/merge. Lets agents work simultaneously on different parts, or even on competing implementations.
**Where I saw it:** Anthropic “Common workflows” + “Best practices” explicitly recommend worktrees for **parallel sessions**; multiple blogs/vids show real setups and gains; teams report it reduces context‑switching and increases throughput. ([Anthropic][5], [Anthropic][6], [Incident][7])
**Popularity:** **90/100**
**Pros:** True concurrency; isolated contexts; great for “frontend here, backend there, tests elsewhere.”
**Cons:** Branch hygiene required; risk of merge pain if scopes overlap. ([DEV Community][8])
**Overall score:** **8.8/10**

---

### 3) **Cross‑review (“two‑AI pair‑programming”)**: Bugbot for PRs, Claude Code as linter/CI check

**How it works:** Use Cursor’s **Bugbot** to review PR diffs in GitHub; wire Claude Code into your build or pre‑commit as a linter/reviewer that comments on issues vs `main`. Human approves final merges.
**Where I saw it:** Cursor’s Bugbot docs + coverage; Anthropic’s “add Claude to your verification process” example; community tutorials. ([Cursor][9], [WIRED][10], [Anthropic][5])
**Popularity:** **84/100**
**Pros:** Continuous quality gate; catches security/logic issues early; great for teams.
**Cons:** False positives if prompts/rules are weak; costs scale with PR chatter. ([Cursor][9])
**Overall score:** **8.5/10**

---

### 4) **Planner/Oracle vs. Executor** split: Claude plans/architects; Cursor implements/refactors

**How it works:** Use Claude Code (with **CLAUDE.md** memory) to define architecture, specs, tasks; execute in Cursor (Ask/Inline/Agent) for multi‑file edits/refactors; bounce defects back to CC for diagnosis. This mirrors the hybrid path in your doc.&#x20;
**Where I saw it:** Reddit threads literally name this “Oracle (Claude) / Executor (Cursor)”; comparison blogs and tips posts echo the split. ([Reddit][11], [Qodo][12], [Builder.io][13])
**Popularity:** **80/100**
**Pros:** Keeps big‑picture reasoning in one place; Cursor stays laser‑focused on edits/diffs.
**Cons:** Can feel “chat‑heavy” if planning is vague; requires tidy CLAUDE.md and scoped tasks. ([Anthropic][14])
**Overall score:** **8.3/10**

---

### 5) **Long‑running agentic tasks** in Claude Code; **Cursor** as the oversight/diff gate

**How it works:** Let CC run extended sequences (migrations, refactors, codebase‑wide changes) while you keep coding elsewhere; reconcile results in Cursor with review commits and tests.
**Where I saw it:** Reports of **Opus 4** handling multi‑hour coding runs and complex refactors; Anthropic docs describe agentic/terminal‑first workflows. ([IT Pro][15], [Anthropic][16])
**Popularity:** **72/100**
**Pros:** Great for grunt work and sweeping refactors; reduces human tedium.
**Cons:** Drift risk if not bounded by tests/rules; supervision time still needed.
**Overall score:** **7.9/10**

---

### 6) **Multi‑candidate coding**: run several CC agents on the *same* spec, pick the winner in Cursor

**How it works:** Launch 2–4 parallel CC runs (isolated branches/worktrees), each implements the same feature; compare diffs and UX; cherry‑pick the best.
**Where I saw it:** Community demos and write‑ups specifically advocate this to exploit LLM non‑determinism. ([Reddit][17], [YouTube][18])
**Popularity:** **58/100** (power users love it; casuals use it less)
**Pros:** Diversity of solutions; surfaces novel designs fast.
**Cons:** Review/merge overhead; duplicate work; token costs.
**Overall score:** **7.2/10**

# Do people use them to **check each other’s code**?

Yes—very commonly. The mainstream pattern is **Bugbot on PRs** + **Claude Code as a lint/review step** in CI or pre‑commit. CC’s docs even include a one‑liner that treats Claude like a Unix linter over your diff; Bugbot posts comments with “Fix in Cursor” deep‑links. ([Anthropic][5], [Cursor][9])

# Do people use them to **code different parts in parallel**?

Also yes—the most cited approach is **git worktrees** (officially recommended) to isolate multiple Claude sessions; devs keep Cursor open to integrate, test, and merge. Teams report faster throughput and less context thrash. ([Anthropic][5], [Anthropic][6])

# Model picks **inside Cursor** (what people prefer by use case)

> Note: this shifts fast; below reflects **Aug 2025** chatter + official notes.

* **Long conversations / whole‑app builds (end‑to‑end)** → **GPT‑5** (now in Cursor). Early reports praise reliability on long contexts and one‑shot build success; Cursor’s own post says it’s “quite effective for coding.” ([Cursor][19], [Axios][20], [Latent Space][21])
* **Long‑running, stepwise refactors & CLI/terminal tasks** → **Claude Opus 4**. Known for sustained agentic work and strong SWE‑bench performance; multiple users say Opus is particularly good with bash/CLI. ([IT Pro][15], [Reddit][22])
* **UI/styling & “design‑savvy” frontend code** → **Claude Sonnet 4**. Many dev posts prefer Sonnet for tasteful UI and CSS; Anthropic positions Sonnet 4 as a major upgrade over 3.7. ([DEV Community][23], [Anthropic][24])
* **Fast, cheap iteration / small fixes** → **OpenAI o3‑mini‑high** (or similar compact models) when supported; some Cursor users report surprising refactor wins at lower cost. **Use with caution** for large, nuanced edits. ([Cursor - Community Forum][25])

Your guide’s **hybrid** recommendation—plan/architect in Claude Code (with **CLAUDE.md** memory), then implement/refine in Cursor—lines up with current best practice and keeps both tools in their lane.  Also, CC’s official docs formalize **CLAUDE.md** tiers (org/user/project) and imports, which helps multiple windows/agents stay in sync—even across worktrees. ([Anthropic][14])

---

# Why I scored popularity the way I did

I looked for **official documentation**, **recent (last 2 months) posts**, and **recurring patterns** across blogs/Reddit/YouTube. Strategies backed by official docs + multiple independent demos got higher popularity.

---

## Quick recommendations (actionable)

* If you want one thing today: **install CC in Cursor** and adopt the **Review‑button discipline** from your doc’s edit‑test loop. You’ll feel a speed bump immediately.&#x20;
* For speed on multi‑feature sprints: adopt **worktrees** (1 per feature) + **Bugbot on PRs** + **Claude linter script** in CI. That’s the most repeatable “team” setup I found. ([Anthropic][5], [Cursor][9])
* Model defaults: **GPT‑5** for long sessions; **Opus 4** for agentic/CLI heavy tasks; **Sonnet 4** for frontend polish. Switch per task; don’t force one model for everything. ([Cursor][19], [IT Pro][15])

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny `_docs/ai-context/` page (with the model picker + scripts for `lint:claude` and a sample Bugbot config) so you can drop it straight into your template.
